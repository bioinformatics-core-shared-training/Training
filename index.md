# Training

The Bioinformatics Core offers courses throughout the year. Many of them are classroom-based courses delivered in collaboration with the University's [Bioinformatics Training Facility](https://bioinfotraining.bio.cam.ac.uk/), with a focus on hands-on, practical learning.

## Upcoming Courses

The Bioinformatics Core members run or teach the following training courses.
